Hi and welcome ! My name is [Santiago Schumacher], and I'm an Information Systems Engineer for Argentina. 
This is my first time dabbling into the Blogging community, and, as a Test Automation, I intent to write about tips, best practices, frameworks and other things I've learned along the way in over 5 years experience in the field.
If you have doubts, questions, ideas or corncers feel free to hit me up ! My contact information is posted below.

Hope you learn something reading from me, and you get to apply something that'll help make your Automated tests more stable and less prone to errors.

See you !
