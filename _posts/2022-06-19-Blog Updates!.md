Hey, everyone !

After a long hiatus, I'm finally back and resuming posting on this blog.

Despite my hiatus, there have been several updates and improvements to my public <a href='https://github.com/santiautomation/santi-automation-framework'>Test Automation Framework</a>, so feel free to
take a look, clone/fork the repository or use it in your projects.

<h2> Repository Updates </h2>

Between others, these are the changes pushed to the repository in the past few weeks:
* Multiple Application Support: Now it's much simpler to test different applications, with different hosts, and potentially using different platforms (Web App, API, Mobile..)
* Multi-Environment Tests: Execute a test suite against Development, QA or your Production Environment by using Maven Profiles.
* Added <a href="https://www.extentreports.com/">Extent Reports</a> and integrated to our custom Logging, for beautiful reports upon a completed test suite.
* Fixed minor bugs regarding multi-threading.
* Added API Test supports with <a href="https://rest-assured.io/">RestAssured</a>

And also, on a more personal note:

* Integrated <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> on the Blog ! So post your comments and questions away.
* Other than the blog, I will start posting similar content on my <a href="https://medium.com/@santiagoschumacher2">Medium Account</a>, so please give me a follow there as well.

Until the next time, and happy testing,
Santiago.
