<h1>Welcome !</h1>

Hello everybody ! 
I've decided to write my first post to let you know what to expect from the upcoming posts. 
There will be two different sections:

<ol>
  <div><li>Framework</li><fieldset>
	In this section we'll go through a real-world, production-ready framework starting from scratch that'll help you write Automated Tests
	that are reliable and robust. 
	We'll start building it step-by-step detailing my decisions, and sharing my code.
	</fieldset></div>
  
  <div><li>Miscellaneous</li><fieldset>
	Here I will share different tips, tricks libraries, anything relevant to test automation that I believe will make you excell in your career.
	</fieldset></div>
</ol>

<br>

<h2>Technology Stack</h2>
Our framework will include the following, including, but not limited to:

<ul>
  <li>Programming Language: Java</li>
  <li>Selenium, for web automation</li>
  <li>Maven, dependency management and others</li>
  <li>Appium for Mobile automation</li>
  <li>RestAssured: API Testing</li>
